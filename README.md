# Intro to CAD by WhyNotStem ONSHAPE


Welcome to Intro to CAD, your practical guide to learning CAD through simple, clear, and hands-on chapters. This repository is designed for students and beginners who want to build real skills without getting lost in technical jargon.

We will be using Onshape because it wins based on the features/pricing etc over other CAD, in my opinion.
